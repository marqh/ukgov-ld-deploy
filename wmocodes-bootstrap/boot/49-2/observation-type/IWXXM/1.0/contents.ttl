The result of this observation type shall refer to an entity of type MeteorologicalAerodromeTrendForecastRecord. MeteorologicalAerodromeTrendForecast additionally enforces that the sampled feature must be an Aerodrome. MeteorologicalAerodromeTrendForecasts are reported in surface observation reports such as SPECI and METAR. MeteorologicalAerodromeTrendForecast has a sister class for trend forecast information at an Aerodrome (MeteorologicalAerodromeObservation) which is also reported on a METAR and SPECI for observed phenomena.  This class is also related but not identical to MeteorologicalAerodromeForecast which is reported on a TAF - conditions reported in trend forecasts in METAR/SPECI differ from forecast groups in a TAF."@en ;
