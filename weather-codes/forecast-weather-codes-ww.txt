Note: Use of precipitation type IC "Ice crystals" is deprecated as of Amd 76 to ICAO Annex 3 (Nov 2013)
Note: Use of precipitation type SG "Snow grains" shall only be used without qualification of SH (shower) or TS (thunderstorm)
Note: Use of precipitation types GS "Small hail and/or snow pellets" and GR "Hail" shall only be used with qualification of SH (shower) or TS (thunderstorm)
Note: SH (Shower) cannot be reported with qualifying precipitation
Note: Given regulation (15.14.12) and (51.5.1) [below], reporting of light intensity precipitation is prohibited for forecast weather except in relation to thunderstorms and freezing precipitation
Note: Given regulation (15.14.12) and (51.5.1) [below], reporting of weather phenomena in the vicinity is assumed to be prohibited
Note: When reporting forecast weather for TAF and METAR trend forecasts the following regulation applies (51.5.1 and 15.14.12)

    Inclusion of significant forecast weather w’w’, using the appropriate abbreviations in accordance
    with Regulation 15.8, shall be restricted to indicate:
    (1) the onset, cessation or change in intensity of the following weather phenomena:
    - Freezing precipitation;
    - Moderate or heavy precipitation (including showers);
    - Duststorm;
    - Sandstorm;
    - Thunderstorm (with precipitation)
    (2) the onset or cessation of the following weather phenomena:
    - Freezing fog;
    - Ice crystals;
    - Low drifting dust, sand or snow;
    - Blowing dust, sand or snow;
    - Thunderstorm (without precipitation);
    - Squall;
    - Funnel cloud (tornado or waterspout);
    - Other weather phenomena – given in Code table 4678 shall be included as
      agreed by the meteorological authority with the air traffic services authority
      and operators concerned.
